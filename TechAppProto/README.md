# Neighborhood map - Places to visit in Madurai

Neighborhood map is a web application that displays a list of places to visit in the city **Madurai**.
The app displays a list of tourist spots both on the side bar and on a integrated Google map. Users could use the search box for searching a specific place, the app displays the Spots on the map with Wikipedia articles about them. Happy visiting :)
